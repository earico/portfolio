            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 24px">Hello, my name is Eleazar and I am a CS Student who enjoys coding from time
                                        to time. Some of the things that I have worked on include my own Linux machine, 
                                        dabbling a bit with Discord bots, to even coding scripts in Lua to be used in
                                        video games such as Minecraft's ComputerCraft mod or even Roblox Lua Scripting. 
                                        I enjoy playing video games and would like to one day create my own as it's one 
                                        of the things I've been passionate about since I was a child. I also enjoy 
                                        drawing in my free time and if you head over to my art tab, you'll see some of 
                                        the things I've created. </p>
